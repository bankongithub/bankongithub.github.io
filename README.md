## Guide

Oh, brother, in this era of popular Ethereum, do you have your own Ethereum? If you are poor and can't afford those things, you can experience JB. The front-end and back-end of this system are all open source and deployed on GitHub, so this system has no secret to you, just like Rem-wife naked (oh, Rem is my wife, so she only naked in my bedroom). All transactions in this area depend on issues, so if you want to transfer money, you have to mention an issue. GitHub Actions will automatically complete the transaction. Well, enjoy it : )

## What is Bank on GitHub?

Bank on GitHub is a bank system based on GitHub (especially GitHub Actions). We used ETH wallet algorithm to protect your money, all the transactions will be deposited on the issue, so if you want to make a transfer, just new a issue (with ETH private key signature when sending). If you want to start, just generate an ETH wallet!
